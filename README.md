A small [pixel-editor toy for the browser](https://matt-dray.github.io/little-pixel-fun-zone/). Click the squares on/off to draw a little picture.

Built with [{shiny}](https://shiny.posit.co/) and prepared for serverless deployment with [{shinylive}](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/). Recycles code from [{pixeltrix}](https://github.com/matt-dray/pixeltrix), an interactive pixel-editor for the R graphics window.

Intended for learning purposes. May never be 'finished'.
